This is a simple program that takes user input from the keyboard and converts
it to Morse Code via an LED attached to an Arduino board.

Future goals for this project:
1. Convert Morse Code from light to text
2. Create sounds for the Morse Code
3. Convert Morse Code from sound to text (and/or light)
4. Allow a user to "tap" in the Morse Code using a small button
